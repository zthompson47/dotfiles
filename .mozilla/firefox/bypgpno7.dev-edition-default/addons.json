Replace Firefox's control mechanism with one modelled on Vim.\n\nThis addon is very usable, but is in an early stage of development. We intend to implement the majority of Vimperator's features.","fullDescription":"Replace Firefox's control mechanism with one modelled on VIM.\nMost common tasks you want your browser to perform are bound to a single key\npress:\n\n    You want to open a new tab? Hit t.\n    You want to follow that link? Hit f and type the displayed label.\n    You want to go to the bottom of the page? Hit G. Or the top? gg.\n    You want to focus the text field on Wikipedia to search for another term? gi.\n    Switch to the next tab? gt.\n    Go back in time? H.\n    Notice that this tab is rubbish and you want to close it? d.\n    Regret that decision? u restores it.\n    Want to write something in Vim? Ctrl-i in a text box opens it in Vim, if\n    you have :native working.\n    Temporarily disable all that magic because you can't stand it? Shift-Insert.\n    But how do you use your browser now? Shift-Insert again and we're back on.\n\nThe list could go on a bit here, but I guess you'll get the point. If you feel\nlost sometimes :help might help you a lot.\nHighlighted features:\n\n    follow any link on the site with just 2-3 key presses.\n    switch to any open tab by searching for its URL or title or entering its ID.\n    easy customizable search settings\n    bind any supported command or commands to the key (sequence) of your liking\n    great default bindings (if you're used to Pentadactyl or Vimperator)\n\nThis add-on is very usable, but is in an early stage of development. We intend\nto implement the majority of Vimperator's features.\nYou can get beta builds from our website.\nPermissions:\nSince Tridactyl aims to provide all the features Vimperator and Pentadactyl\nhad, it requires quite a few permissions. Here we describe the specific\npermissions and why we need them.\n\n    Access your data for all websites:\n        This is Mozilla's way of saying that Tridactyl can read the content of web\n        pages. This is necessary in order to e.g. find the links you can follow\n        with the :hint command (bound to f by default).\n    Exchange messages with programs other than Firefox\n        This permission is required for Tridactyl to interact with your\n        operating system (opening your editor to edit text areas, sending links to\n        your video player, reading a configuration file from your disk...). This\n        is possible thanks to an external executable we provide. If you feel this\n        gives Tridactyl too much power you can chose not to install the external\n        executable: Tridactyl will still work but won't be able to start external\n        programs.\n    Read and modify bookmarks:\n        Tridactyl's command line has a powerful autocompletion mechanism. In\n        order to be able to autocomplete your bookmarks, Tridactyl needs to read\n        them.\n    Clear recent browsing history, cookies, and related data:\n        Tridactyl implements the :sanitise command Vimperator and Pentadactyl\n        had. It works a bit like the \"Clear All History\" dialog you can access by\n        pressing Ctrl+Shift+Del on default Firefox.\n    Get data from the clipboard:\n        If your clipboard contains a URL, pressing p will make Tridactyl follow\n        this URL in the current tab.\n    Input data to the clipboard:\n        Tridactyl lets you copy various elements to the clipboard such as a page's\n        URL with yy, a link's URL with ;y or the content of an HTML element\n        with ;p.\n    Download files and read and modify the browser's download history:\n        By pressing ;s, ;S, ;a and ;A you can save documents and pictures\n        from a page to your download folder.\n    Access browsing history:\n        The URLs of websites you've visited previously can be suggested as\n        arguments for :tabopen and similar commands.\n    Access recently closed tabs:\n        If you've accidentally closed a tab or window, Tridactyl will let you open\n        it again with the :undo command which is bound to u by default.\n    Access browser tabs:\n        Tridactyl provides a quick tab-switching menu/command with the :buffer\n        command (bound to b). This permission is also required to close, move,\n        and pin tabs, amongst other things.\n    Access browser activity during navigation:\n        This is needed for Tridactyl to be able to go back to normal mode every\n        time you open a new page. In the future we may use it for autocommands.","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/202/202002.png?modified=1543520971","width":2400,"height":1350,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/202/202002.png?modified=1543520971","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":360},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/193/193704.png?modified=1543520972","width":700,"height":385,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/193/193704.png?modified=1543520972","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":352},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/193/193703.png?modified=1543520973","width":700,"height":385,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/193/193703.png?modified=1543520973","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":352},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/193/193705.png?modified=1543520974","width":700,"height":385,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/193/193705.png?modified=1543520974","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":352},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/191/191470.png?modified=1543520975","width":700,"height":384,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/191/191470.png?modified=1543520975","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":351}],"homepageURL":"https://github.com/cmcaine/tridactyl","supportURL":"https://github.com/cmcaine/tridactyl/issues","contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.7847,"reviewCount":116,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tridactyl-vim/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":481,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3441168/tridactyl-1.17.1-an+fx.xpi?src=","updateDate":1573475633000},{"id":"CookieAutoDelete@kennydo.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/784/784287-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/784/784287-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/784/784287-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"type":"extension","name":"Cookie AutoDelete","version":"3.0.2","creator":{"name":"CAD Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12748480/"},"developers":[],"description":"Control your cookies!

Use GitHub instead.\n\nPlease note that even if it doesn't work for you, it works for other people so it's probably a problem with your Firefox settings and not with the extension. See troubleshooting steps.\n\nPermission Request Explanations\n- Access your data for all websites: CAD requests this to delete cookies for all sites\n- Clear recent browsing history, cookies and related data: Ability to delete Localstorage.\n- Display notifications to you: Self explanatory.\n- Read and modify privacy settings: Automatic detection of First Party Isolation support. Although the Privacy permission gives CAD \"read and modify\" permissions, NO MODIFICATIONS are done to your privacy settings, CAD only reads the setting of First Party Isolation. The privacy permission unfortunately cannot be given granular control, so this will stay for now.\n- Access browser tabs: CAD uses this permission to display the site hostname in the popup for easy whitelisting/greylisting, displaying the amount of cookies for that site, and which rules apply to that site.\n\nTake the permission wording with a grain of salt.\n\nMain Features\n- Auto Deletes Cookies from Closed Tabs\n- WhiteList/GreyList Support for Cookies\n- Easily Export/Import your Whitelist/Greylist\n- Clear All Cookies for a Domain\n- Supports Manual Mode Cleaning from the popup\n- Easily See the Number of Cookies for a site\n- Support for Container Tabs (Firefox 53+ Only)\n\nUsage\nThis extension does not clean cookies automatically until you enable \"Auto-clean\". This gives you the chance to add sites to the WhiteList.\n\n1. Add the sites you want to keep cookies in the WhiteList (permanently) or GreyList (until Browser restart)\n2. Toggle \"Auto-clean\" in the popup or \"Automatic cleaning\" in the settings\n3. Watch those unused cookies disappear :)\n\nYou must enable cookies in the browser as this extension will replace the internal cookie manager.\n\nYou can disable Cleanup Notifications via the Settings.\n\nPopup Menu Features\nClean: This is basically a quick way of activating the Cookie Cleanup on demand. This looks at all your cookies and deletes them if they are not in any Open Tabs or the WhiteList.\nClean, include open tabs: Same thing as Cookie Cleanup except that it only deletes cookies only if they are not in the WhiteList. Open tabs are not taken into consideration.\nClear All Cookies for This Domain: Easy way to delete all cookies for one particular domain that you are on.\n\nSome things to Note:\n- This extension can clear localstorage as of version 2.1.0 and Firefox 58+. Enable it in the settings.\n\n- Even though third party cookies are cleared with this extension, it is better to disable third party cookies from the settings\n\nDocumentation\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you have any other problem, file an issue on GitHub. Maybe we can work it out.\n\nBTC: 16km6pFV33S6kaeb8rCaDLZXUyo3uyVnsk","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/189/189656.png?modified=1543520768","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189656.png?modified=1543520768","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/185/185648.png?modified=1543520768","width":413,"height":135,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/185/185648.png?modified=1543520768","thumbnailWidth":413,"thumbnailHeight":135,"caption":"Notifications"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/189/189657.png?modified=1543520769","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189657.png?modified=1543520769","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/189/189658.png?modified=1543520769","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189658.png?modified=1543520769","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Expression Table"}],"homepageURL":"https://github.com/mrdokenny/Cookie-AutoDelete","supportURL":"https://github.com/Cookie-AutoDelete/Cookie-AutoDelete/issues","contributionURL":"https://www.paypal.me/mrkennyd/5?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.5769,"reviewCount":450,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":11178,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/1906813/cookie_autodelete-3.0.2-an+fx.xpi?src=","updateDate":1556488510000},{"id":"jid1-MnnxcxisBPnSXQ@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/506/506646-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/506/506646-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/506/506646-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"Privacy Badger","version":"2020.1.13","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3484647/privacy_badger-2020.1.13-an+fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://www.eff.org/privacybadger","supportURL":"https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger","description":"Automatically learns to block invisible trackers.","fullDescription":"Privacy Badger automatically learns to block invisible trackers.
